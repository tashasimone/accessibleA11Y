                <h2>How It Started</h2>
                <p>
                    I was searching for a way to fulfill the requirements for my capstone project
                    of my B.A. in Visual Communication Design. After searching for a project, I 
                    realized I wanted to not only fulfill requirements, but to actually make a 
                    difference with my project. Growing up I was surrounded by people on the ability
                    spectrum, without even realizing it. Getting into the field of web design, I 
                    realized that many people don't access the web in the same way that I do, and 
                    that they ended up being excluded from some experiences on the web. Researching 
                    more into web accessibility, the more I realized that while there were many resources
                    available, it was hard to piece them all together. I decided to solve this issue 
                    by creating this site as a resource to compile all the standards, tutorials, tools, 
                    examples, and motivations behind accessibility into one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also hope this site can serve to dispell the myths that accessibility cannot look 
                    good, that someone's audience wouldn’t benefit from accessibility measures, and that 
                    accessibility is too difficult to implement.
                </p>
